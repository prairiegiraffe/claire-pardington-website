            Claire Pardington is a visionary designer and creative director whose work spans fashion and the broader
            world of visual storytelling. A graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, she began
            her career at Calvin Klein Collection and, by 25, was serving as Senior Designer of the Designer Collection
            at Victoria's Secret. After earning her MBA at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business—where
            she was recognized as 2022's 'Entrepreneur of the Year'—she launched Pardington Collective, a conceptual
            brand exploring the intersection of style, art, and experience.

            Blending imagination with precision, Claire is known for creating work that feels both architectural and
            emotive—collections and concepts that transcend garments to become fully realized worlds. Her practice is
            defined by elegance, confidence, and an unwavering pursuit of designs that leave a lasting impact.
